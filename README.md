# Adventures of Blink

Adventures of Blink is a story-driven rogue-RPG built with **Unity 2022.3 LTS**. You play as Ben "Blink" Kade, a mild-mannered developer who becomes a code-wielding hero alongside his robotic min-pin Duke. Together they battle renegade programs and uncover the truth behind the mysterious AI known as Specter. Real-time combat, hacking puzzles and branching quests drive the adventure across five acts and an epilogue.

## Game Concept
Blink's journey spans Data City, from underground clubs to virtual reality theaters. Allies such as Eli Ramirez and Dr. Cass Vale provide help, while hostile utilities like Splice, Loop and Mutex threaten the city. Choices influence relationships and unlock side content, culminating in the unification of forgotten code.

### Story Arc
The campaign unfolds over five main acts and a post-credits epilogue. Each act introduces new locations, bosses and side quests that expand the world and bring Blink closer to integrating Specter with Data City's systems.
