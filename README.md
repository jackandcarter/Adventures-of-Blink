# Adventures of Blink

Adventures of Blink is a rogue-RPG built in **Unity 6.1**. By day you are Ben "Blink" Kade, a UI programmer at DataWorks. By night you become the CodeWarrior Blink, a vigilante who uses a custom shader implant to hide his identity and augment his senses. With help from Duke, a robotic min-pin companion, Blink hunts hostile hologram programs that threaten DataCity and the Zenith A.I. that keeps it stable.

The project is in early setup. The vision includes hack-and-slash battles with a plasma sword, a companion ability system for Duke, a macOS-style dock for quick items and skills, weather effects, and upgrades for Blink's implant and Duke's parts. Movement will support WSAD or mouse input, with combo attacks triggered by timing.
